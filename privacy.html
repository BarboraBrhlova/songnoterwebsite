        <h3><a id="information-process">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</a></h3>
        <p style="font-style: italic;"><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is
            necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under
            applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with
            services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your
            rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</p>
        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid
            legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such,
            we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e.,
                    consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can
                    withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about <a href="#consent">withdrawing your consent.</a></li>
                <li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we
                    believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including
                    providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with
                    you.</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is
                    reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those
                    interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.
                    For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes
                    described in order to understand how our users use our products and services so
                    we can improve user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is
                    necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a
                    law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights,
                    or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
                <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is
                    necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third
                    party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any
                    person.</li>
            </ul>
        <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</p>
        <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e.,
            express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in
            situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You
            can <a href="#consent">withdraw your consent at any time.</a></p>
        <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to
            process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be
                    obtained in a timely way</li>
                <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
                <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
                <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to
                    assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
                <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of
                    kin</li>
                <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be
                    victim of financial abuse</li>
                <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise
                    the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is
                    reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a
                    contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
                <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or
                    rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
                <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business,
                    or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the
                    information was produced</li>
                <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
                <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
            </ul>

        <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom
            (UK), then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or
            other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will
            take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance
            with this privacy notice and applicable law.</p>
        <p>European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses:</p>

        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for
            the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is
            required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal
            requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal
            information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account
            with us.</p>
        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
            information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is
            not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in
            backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and
            isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
        <h3><a id="chapter7">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</a></h3>
        <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of

        <h3><a id="chapter10">10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</a></h3>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
            include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal
            your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
            monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
            recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
            currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
            automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
            for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform
            you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
